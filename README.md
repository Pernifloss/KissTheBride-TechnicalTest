This a technical test for Kiss the bride.


# Instruction:

## Front-end web-dev-test

This exercise is meant to test your basic front-end coding skills. In this part you are asked to build a front-end around the API you have made earlier or we gave you.

The test should be performed in a git repository

Good luck! :)

### Back-end

A back end is available at https://test-recrutement.loyaltyexpert.net/

The API documentation is at https://test-recrutement.loyaltyexpert.net/api/doc


### Front-end (React or Angular)

For the front end part, you will build a web page that will display a list of products taken from the API built earlier or gave.

Products should be listed in a responsive grid. Think mobile!
Add pagination
Add product search
Add a form to create a new product or update one
Use React or Angular 1/2 to build the website.
Bonus:

Add filtering by brand / categories
A good look on the frontend will be appreciated
Add tests
The quality of commits, documentation, logic is important as well.
